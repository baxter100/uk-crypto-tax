<h2>Capital Gains calculated for {TAX_YEAR_START}/{TAX_YEAR_END} </h2>
<h3>Values for Proceeds, Cost basis, fee and gain/loss are given in {NATIVE_CURRENCY} </h3>
<h3>Calculated from file: {INPUT_TRADE_CSV} </h3>

<h3> Number of Disposals: {NUMBER_OF_DISPOSALS}.</h3>
<h3> Value of fees paid when disposing of assets for {NATIVE_CURRENCY}: {DISPOSAL_FEE_VALUE}. </h3>
<h3> Gain from days: {DAY_GAINS}. Gain from bed and breakfasting: {BNB_GAINS}. Gain from 104 Holdings: {AVG_GAINS}</h3>
<h3> Gain from leftover disposals using FIFO with accompanying buy trades in the future: {FUTURE_GAINS}.</h3>
<h3> Gain from leftover disposals with no accompanying buy: {UNACCOUNTED_GAINS}</h3>

<h3>Disposal Proceeds: {TOTAL_PROCEEDS}. Allowable Costs: {TOTAL_COSTS}. Total Capital Gains for
    {TAX_YEAR_START}/{TAX_YEAR_END}: {TOTAL_GAINS}</h3>
<h3> Total Taxable Gain for 2019/2020 (assuming usual allowances): {TOTAL_TAXABLE_GAINS} </h3>
<h3> Total tax owed at 10% tax rate: {TAX_OWED} </h3>

<p>In the following table a detailed list of gains is given (gains are portions of disposals which have been assigned a
    cost basis according to the given rules). The given gain type is the rule used to calculated the
    gain. Note "FIFO (future)" indicates the gain is calculated by matching the disposal using FIFO on future trades.
    "Unaccounted" indicates that there is no corresponding by for that portion of the disposal and therefore the cost
    basis is set to 0. Amount is the amount of the disposal accounted for in this gain.</p>
